# pickplace_arm — autonomous mobile pick-and-place

A **Clearpath Husky A200** mobile base carrying a **Franka Emika FR3** 7-DOF arm
with a **Franka Hand** gripper, simulated in ROS 2 Humble + Gazebo Harmonic.

<!-- Drop the file at docs/images/banner.gif -- see docs/images/README.md -->
![Pick-and-place mission](docs/images/banner.gif)

The robot runs one complete autonomous mission end to end: it localizes itself
on a saved map of a warehouse, drives to a table, picks three coloured cubes off
it one at a time using its front camera, carries each across the room, places it
on the matching-coloured column, verifies the placement actually landed, and
parks.

Everything the robot needs is in this repository. There are no external
description packages to clone.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Ubuntu | 22.04 |
| ROS 2 | Humble |
| Gazebo | Harmonic (`gz-sim8`, tested on 8.14.0) |
| `ros_gz` | Harmonic variant — `ros-humble-ros-gzharmonic-*` |

Install the ROS-side dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    ros-humble-ros-gzharmonic \
    ros-humble-moveit \
    ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup \
    ros-humble-slam-toolbox \
    ros-humble-robot-localization \
    ros-humble-joint-trajectory-controller \
    ros-humble-diff-drive-controller \
    ros-humble-joint-state-broadcaster
```

`gz_ros2_control` and `pymoveit2` are **included in this repository** (under
`src/`) and are built from source with the rest of the workspace — there is
nothing extra to clone.

---

## Build

`gz_ros2_control` selects its Gazebo backend from the `GZ_VERSION` environment
variable at configure time, so it **must** be set before building:

```bash
cd ~/arm_ws
export GZ_VERSION=harmonic
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

`--symlink-install` is recommended: URDF, launch, config and RViz files are then
symlinked from `src/`, so editing them takes effect without rebuilding. Python
modules are still copied, so **changing a `.py` under
`pickplace_arm_bringup/` does need a rebuild** of that package:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select pickplace_arm_bringup --symlink-install
```

A clean build of all five packages takes roughly 15 seconds.

---

## Run the mission

```bash
cd ~/arm_ws
export GZ_VERSION=harmonic
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch pickplace_arm_bringup mission_pickPlace.launch.py
```

Launch arguments:

| Argument | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `use_rviz` | `true` | Start RViz with the full mission layout. |
| `use_gazebo_gui` | `true` | `false` runs Gazebo headless (server only). Sensor rendering happens on the server, so nothing is lost but the scenery — and it saves a lot of RAM. |

On a machine with nothing else running, the mission starts driving **13–18
seconds** after launch (measured across runs), and a full three-box run takes
about **6 minutes** of wall clock.

> **Before every launch, make sure no simulator is still running.** See
> [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) — this is the single most common cause of
> strange failures in this project.

---

## What the mission does

The world is the OpenRobotics *Tugbot in Warehouse* Fuel scene. The props are
spawned into it by the launch file:

- a **table** at map (2.30, 0.00), top surface 0.30 m off the floor
- three **6 cm cubes** on the table — red, green, blue
- three **columns** at map x = −1.0, 20 cm square, of heights **0.30 / 0.40 /
  0.50 m**, each painted the colour of the cube that belongs on it

<!-- Drop the file at docs/images/gazebo.png -- see docs/images/README.md -->
![The scene in Gazebo](docs/images/gazebo.png)

*The Tugbot warehouse: the robot, the table with the three cubes, and the three
matching columns.*

For each cube, in order:

1. **Navigate** to the table with Nav2 on the saved map (AMCL localization).
2. **Approach** — a front-camera colour visual servo drives the base until the
   cube sits under the gripper's fixed action point.
3. **Grasp** — the arm descends straight down, the jaws close, and the grasp is
   *verified* from the finger joint position before anything else happens.
4. **Weld** — a Gazebo `DetachableJoint` rigidly attaches the cube. Friction
   alone lost the box on every carry; the weld cannot slip.
5. **Carry** — the arm tucks into a compact carry pose and the base drives
   across the room.
6. **Place** — a second visual servo centres the base on the matching column,
   the arm lowers the cube onto its top and releases.
7. **Verify** — the front camera looks for the cube *above the column top*. If
   it is not there, the placement is reported FAILED rather than silently
   assumed good.

Finally the robot drives to a parking pose and reports `MISSION 2: DONE`.

Typical verified output:

```
[place] verified: red box at z=0.201 (column top ~0.198)
[place] verified: green box at z=0.303 (column top ~0.298)
[place] verified: blue box at z=0.405 (column top ~0.398)
=== MISSION 2: DONE ===
```

### A note on the behaviour modules

`mission_pickPlace.launch.py` is the only mission launch file, but the class it
runs is the end of an inheritance chain:

```
PickAndPlace → SearchAndPick → NavAndPick → Mission → Mission2 → Mission2Tugbot
```

So `pick_and_place.py`, `search_and_pick.py`, `nav_and_pick.py`, `mission.py`
and `mission_2.py` are all still imported at runtime. They are **not** dead code
— they simply no longer have console entry points of their own.

---

## The robot

`base_link` is the Husky A200 chassis origin and the kinematic root, sitting
**0.13228 m** above the floor (`wheel_radius − wheel_vertical_offset`).

### Kinematics

| Group | Joints |
| --- | --- |
| Base | 4 × continuous wheel joints (`front/rear_left/right_wheel_joint`) |
| Arm | 7 × revolute, `fr3_joint1` … `fr3_joint7` |
| Gripper | `fr3_finger_joint1` (prismatic), `fr3_finger_joint2` mimics it |

The Husky top plate carries the arm: `top_plate_default_mount` is 0.38367 m off
the ground, and `fr3_link0` stands directly on it.

### Sensors

| Sensor | Modelled as | Mount | Pose in `base_link` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Front RGB-D | Intel RealSense **D455** | bolted flat on the chassis front panel | (0.425, 0, 0.091) → **0.223 m** off the floor |
| Wrist RGB-D | Intel RealSense **D405** | side of the Franka Hand, looking along the approach axis | `fr3_hand` (0.043, 0, 0.04) |
| 2D LIDAR | SICK **TiM5xx** (TiM571) | standing on the top plate | scan plane **0.447 m** off the floor, 270° arc |
| IMU | — | inside the chassis | (0, 0, 0.12) |

Two geometry details that are easy to get wrong and are documented in the URDF:

- The LIDAR mesh's base plate is **0.06296 m** below its laser centre, *not* the
  0.05595 that SICK's own macro declares. Using SICK's number sinks the housing
  into the top plate.
- Clearpath's `wheel.dae` is a 7-inch-radius tyre while every other A200 number
  says 6.5 inch. The visual mesh is therefore scaled by `0.1651/0.1778` in its
  two radial axes, or the wheels render 12.7 mm into the ground.

---

## Controllers

Defined in `pickplace_arm_description/config/arm_controllers.yaml`, all driven
by a single `gz_ros2_control/GazeboSimSystem`:

| Controller | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `joint_state_broadcaster` | `joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster` |
| `arm_controller` | `joint_trajectory_controller/JointTrajectoryController` |
| `gripper_controller` | `joint_trajectory_controller/JointTrajectoryController` |
| `diff_drive_controller` | `diff_drive_controller/DiffDriveController` |

Check them with:

```bash
ros2 control list_controllers
```

All four should read `active`.

> The A200 and FR3 are both included with their own `ros2_control` blocks
> disabled (`use_platform_controllers:=false`, `ros2_control:=false`). There is
> exactly one control system in this robot, and it lives in
> `pickplace_arm.gazebo.xacro`.

---

## Perception

Both cameras publish organised point clouds through `ros_gz_bridge`:

| Topic | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `/front_camera/points`, `/front_camera/image` | front D455 |
| `/camera/points`, `/camera/image` | wrist D405 |
| `/scan` | LIDAR |
| `/imu` | IMU |

Detection is HSV colour segmentation over the point cloud, returning the blob
centroid in `base_link`.

### Detection gates

This warehouse is full of same-coloured clutter — pallet labels, hazard tape,
shelf trim — and an ungated search will happily lock onto something 3 m away and
1 m up. Every colour detection is therefore **gated** to an axis-aligned box in
the camera frame (X forward, Y left, Z up):

```python
TUGBOT_GATE = (0.05, 2.5, -0.7, 0.7, -0.25, 0.36)
#             xmin  xmax  ymin  ymax  zmin   zmax
```

The z bounds are relative to the **lens**, so they move whenever the camera
moves. They currently admit world heights −0.03 … 0.58 m off the floor, which
covers the cubes on the 0.30 m table and the full height of every column.

> Gazebo publishes its RGB-D clouds in the **gz body convention** (X forward),
> not the ROS optical convention. The sensors are tagged with `camera_link` /
> `front_camera_link` accordingly. Tagging them with the optical frames — which
> is what the `<gz_frame_id>` values *look* like they should be — makes RViz
> rotate the cloud 90° out to the robot's side.

---

## Navigation and localization

- **Map**: `maps/tugbot_warehouse.yaml`, built with slam_toolbox. The robot
  spawns at the map origin, so map frame == world frame.
- **Localization**: AMCL (`config/amcl_tugbot.yaml`), seeded at (0, 0, 0).
- **Planning**: Nav2 controller / planner / smoother / behaviour / BT servers
  (`config/nav2_params.yaml`), started by `nav2.launch.py`.
- **Odometry**: a 4-wheel skid-steer's wheel-only odometry drifts badly in
  heading because of lateral scrub during turns. A `robot_localization` EKF
  (`config/ekf.yaml`) fuses the wheel forward velocity with IMU yaw and
  publishes the single `odom → base_link` transform. The diff-drive
  controller's own odom TF is disabled so there is exactly one publisher.

`cmd_vel` from Nav2's controller server is remapped straight to
`/diff_drive_controller/cmd_vel_unstamped`. The mission's visual servo publishes
to the same topic during approach; the two phases never overlap, so no
arbitration (twist_mux) is needed.

---

## Startup sequencing

The launch file does **not** stage itself on fixed timers. Each stage waits for
the condition it actually needs, via the `wait_for` gate node:

```
gazebo + move_group + RViz
   └─ gate: /clock alive, TF odom→base_link          → spawn table, columns, cubes
   └─ gate: /clock monotonic for 3 s                 → map_server + amcl
        └─ gate: /map_server/get_state, /amcl/get_state → lifecycle manager
             └─ gate: TF map→base_link, /amcl_pose      → nav2
                  └─ gate: /navigate_to_pose, /move_action → mission
```

Two things this fixes, both of which were real failures:

- The old schedule idled **~115 s** waiting for nothing on a clean machine.
- The lifecycle manager used to start in the same breath as the nodes it
  manages. That was survivable at the old 75 s mark, but starting everything
  early made it lose the race outright and abort localization bringup
  (`map_server/get_state service client: async_send_request failed`), leaving no
  `map` frame at all.

Every gate is bounded by a timeout and exits successfully on expiry, so a stuck
check degrades to the old unconditional behaviour rather than bricking the
launch.

### The `/clock` jump-back trap

`wait_for` distinguishes two things that look identical in the logs:

| | cause | magnitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Benign | out-of-order `/clock` delivery — it is BEST_EFFORT over UDP | one 10 ms sim tick |
| **Real** | a second, orphaned `gz` server publishing onto the same `/clock` | whole seconds |

Hence `--jump-threshold` (default 0.1 s): 5× the worst benign reordering,
orders of magnitude below a genuine two-simulator disagreement. A real jump also
prints the likely cause and the command to fix it.

---

## RViz

RViz starts by default and loads
`pickplace_arm_bringup/config/mission.rviz`, which groups displays into
**Robot** (model, TF, EKF odometry), **Navigation** (map, both costmaps,
footprint, global/local plans, AMCL particles), **Perception** (LIDAR, both
point clouds, both camera images) and a MoveIt **MotionPlanning** panel. Two
saved views are included: *Chase robot* and *Gripper close-up*.

<!-- Drop the file at docs/images/rviz.png -- see docs/images/README.md -->
![The RViz mission layout](docs/images/rviz.png)

*Robot model and TF, map and costmaps, the LIDAR scan and both camera feeds,
alongside the MoveIt MotionPlanning panel.*

Two things in that file are deliberate and should not be "tidied":

- The `Panels` and `Window Geometry` sections are copied verbatim from a working
  stock config, because they carry the serialized `QMainWindow State` blob.
  Without it, declaring **any** panel beyond Displays/Views segfaults rviz2
  before its window appears.
- The Grid carries `Offset.Z = -0.13228`. The EKF runs `two_d_mode: true`, which
  forces `z = 0` on `odom → base_link`, so the model hangs 0.13228 m low in TF
  and a grid drawn at z=0 slices the wheels at the axles. This is cosmetic only
  — AMCL, the costmaps and Nav2 are all 2D, and MoveIt plans `base_link`-relative
  — so it is corrected in the view rather than in the filter. Fixing it "properly"
  would mean either letting z random-walk (nothing measures it) or re-rooting the
  URDF at `base_footprint`, which would shift every mission z by 0.13228 m,
  because the URDF root *is* MoveIt's planning frame.

---

## Building a new map

The mission ships with a prebuilt map, so this is only needed for a new world:

```bash
# 1) Drive around with slam_toolbox running
ros2 launch pickplace_arm_bringup mapping.launch.py
ros2 run pickplace_arm_bringup teleop_key        # 2nd terminal: w/s/a/d/x/q

# 2) Save it
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f src/pickplace_arm_bringup/maps/<name>

# 3) Sanity-check localization on the saved map
ros2 launch pickplace_arm_bringup localization.launch.py
```

---

## Vendored third-party assets

The Husky base, the FR3 arm and the sensor housings used to be pulled in at
xacro time from `clearpath_platform_description`, `franka_description`,
`realsense2_description` and `sick_scan_xd`. Those were nested git checkouts
that could not be pushed with this project, so **the subset this robot actually
uses** has been copied into `pickplace_arm_description` and the URIs repointed.
Every `package://` reference in the robot now resolves to this one package.

| Vendored from | What | Where it lives now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clearpath_platform_description` | A200 xacros + meshes | `urdf/vendor/a200/`, `meshes/a200/` |
| `franka_description` | FR3 + Franka Hand macros, yamls, meshes | `urdf/vendor/franka/`, `config/franka/`, `meshes/robots/fr3/`, `meshes/robot_ee/` |
| `realsense2_description` | D455, D405 meshes | `meshes/sensors/` |
| `sick_scan_xd` | TiM5xx mesh | `meshes/sensors/` |

Upstream licences are kept beside the meshes as `LICENSE.<package>`.

The vendored xacros are faithful copies apart from mechanical path rewrites, so
they can be diffed against upstream. **Project-specific changes are kept out of
them** and live in `pickplace_arm.urdf.xacro` instead — the wheel-scale fix, for
example, redefines the `a200_wheel` macro after the include rather than editing
the vendored file.

`gz_ros2_control` carries a local patch (guarding an Ignition-era install target
so it does not break the Harmonic build). It is **already applied** in the
vendored tree — there is nothing to patch after cloning. Because the package is
now tracked as ordinary files rather than a checkout, that change is no longer
visible to `git diff`, so it is written down in
`src/gz_ros2_control/LOCAL_PATCH_NOTES.md`.

---

## Tuned constants worth knowing

Most live in `pick_and_place.py` and `mission_2.py`. These are measured or
derived, not guessed — change them only with a reason.

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GROUND_Z` | −0.13228 | floor height in `base_link` |
| `FRONT_CAM_Z` | 0.22328 | front lens height above the floor |
| `BOX_SIZE` | 0.06 | cube edge |
| `GRIP_OPEN` | 0.038 | jaws clear of the cube |
| `GRIP_CLOSED` | 0.0 | grasp command — **must stay 0**, the empty-grasp check depends on it |
| `GRIP_HOLD` | 0.029 | where the jaws park once the cube is welded |
| `GRIPPER_X` | 0.70 | fixed claw action point ahead of `base_link` |
| `MAX_REACH_X` | 0.85 | hard cap on any commanded forward reach |
| `NAV_STANDOFF` | 1.10 | how far ahead of a column Nav2 parks |
| `COLUMN_STOP_X` | 0.65 | column near-face reading at which the approach stops |

Two of these have subtle reasons behind them:

- **`GRIP_CLOSED` must remain 0.0.** The grasp check works because closing on
  air reads ≈ 0.000 while closing on a cube is stopped by it at ≈ 0.030. Closing
  to anything else makes an empty grasp indistinguishable from a real one.
- **`GRIP_HOLD` exists because welding disables collision.** Once the
  `DetachableJoint` attaches the cube it joins the robot's own articulation,
  box/finger collision switches off, and the still-active 0.0 command pulls the
  jaws straight through the cube. `attach_box()` therefore sends them back out
  onto its faces immediately afterwards.

---

## Performance

The simulation runs at **RTF 1.000** (real time) with RViz and the Gazebo GUI
both up. If it feels slow, something below has drifted.

**RGB-D camera rendering dominates everything else.** Measured on
`gazebo.launch.py` alone — no MoveIt, no Nav2, no RViz — so these are properties
of the simulator itself:

| Configuration | RTF |
| --- | --- |
| Two RGB-D cameras at 30 Hz, Gazebo GUI up | **0.28** |
| Same, headless | 0.47 |
| Cameras at 15 Hz (front) / 5 Hz (wrist), GUI up | **0.80** |
| Full stack — mission + Nav2 + MoveIt + RViz + GUI | **1.00** |

Two things worth taking from that table:

- The ROS side is nearly free. Gazebo alone with the GUI measured 0.281 and the
  entire mission stack on top measured 0.296 — MoveIt and Nav2 cost almost
  nothing. Chasing sim speed means looking at **sensors and rendering**, not at
  the behaviour nodes.
- The camera rates are set to what the code actually consumes, with margin, and
  are documented in `pickplace_arm.gazebo.xacro`. Raising them back to 30 Hz
  will quarter your real-time factor and buys nothing — the tightest consumer,
  the column approach servo, cannot loop faster than about 8 Hz.

Other levers, in order of effect:

| Lever | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `use_gazebo_gui:=false` | Biggest single win after the camera rates. RViz becomes the only viewer; sensors still render on the server. |
| Untick **Front Cloud** in RViz | Point-cloud displays make the bridge serialise a full 640×480 cloud per frame. RViz overall costs ~15% (RTF 0.296 → 0.251). |
| `use_rviz:=false` | Recovers that 15% if you do not need the view. |

Anything that puts RTF far below 1.0 is worth investigating rather than living
with: a starved LIDAR (below ~5 Hz) makes slam_toolbox's scan matcher fail
during rotation, and the map→base_link transform freezes while the robot is
physically turning.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The simulation behaves strangely / AMCL aborts / `/clock` jumps backwards

**An orphaned Gazebo server from a previous run is almost certainly still
alive.** Two simulators publishing onto the same `/clock` disagree by whole
seconds, which makes AMCL throw `tf2::ExtrapolationException` and abort.

Note that `gz sim server` and `gz sim gui` are *separate processes*, and killing
the launch does not always take them with it:

```bash
pkill -9 -f "gz sim"; pkill -9 -f ruby
# then confirm:
ps -ef | grep -E "gz sim|ruby" | grep -v grep
```

Always check this before reporting a bug. It has masqueraded as a world-loading
problem, a localization problem and a controller-spawn timeout.

### Out of memory / the machine grinds

The full stack — Gazebo server + GUI, RViz, MoveIt, Nav2 — is heavy on a 16 GB
machine. Never run a `colcon build` while a simulation is up, and prefer:

```bash
ros2 launch pickplace_arm_bringup mission_pickPlace.launch.py use_gazebo_gui:=false
```

RViz then becomes the single viewer. Sensor rendering happens on the Gazebo
server, so detection is unaffected.

### `ros2 launch` fails with "launch configuration ... does not exist"

Launch executes its action list in order — a `DeclareLaunchArgument` must appear
before anything that substitutes it.

### RViz exits immediately with SIGSEGV

The display config declared a panel without the `QMainWindow State` blob, or
referenced a plugin that is not installed (an `rviz_visual_tools` panel does
this). Neither warns; both crash. See [RViz](#rviz).

### Meshes are missing / the robot spawns invisible

`GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH` must contain the **parent** of the package share
directory. `gazebo.launch.py` sets this automatically; if you launch Gazebo by
hand you have to do it yourself.

### `colcon build` fails after renaming or deleting a file

`--symlink-install` leaves stale symlinks in `build/`. Remove that package's
build and install trees and rebuild:

```bash
rm -rf build/<pkg> install/<pkg>
colcon build --packages-select <pkg> --symlink-install
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Robot model (URDF/Xacro): Husky A200 + FR3 + Franka Hand
- [x] `ros2_control` integration in Gazebo Harmonic
- [x] MoveIt 2 collision-aware motion planning
- [x] RGB-D camera detection — no pre-set pick pose
- [x] Mobile base with LIDAR, IMU and wheel+IMU EKF odometry
- [x] SLAM mapping and AMCL localization
- [x] Nav2 autonomous navigation
- [x] Rigid grasping via `DetachableJoint` (friction alone was not reliable)
- [x] Full colour-sorting mission with verified placement
- [x] Readiness-gated startup (13–18 s to mission start)
- [x] Self-contained workspace — no external description packages
- [ ] Multi-robot / fleet operation
- [ ] Real-hardware bring-up
