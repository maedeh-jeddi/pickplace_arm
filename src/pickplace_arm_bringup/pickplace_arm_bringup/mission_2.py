"""Mission 2: sort 3 coloured boxes from a table onto 3 matching-coloured columns.

Layout (map frame; map origin = robot's spawn pose):
  * A low table holds 3 boxes in a line -- red, green, blue.
  * 3 columns elsewhere, same x, y spaced 0.3 m, heights 8/12/16 cm -- kept low
    so every placement sits well inside the arm's accurate reach -- each
    coloured to match its box (red/green/blue).

For each box i (in order): drive to the table, claw-pick box i by colour,
drive to column i, centre the BASE on it (front camera, colour blob -- same
mechanism as the box pick), and place the box on top of that column at its
known height. Then drive to a final location and stop.

The arm/wrist orientation never changes across the whole mission: it holds
the zdown ("gripper straight down") pose from pick through carry through
place. Column alignment is done entirely by driving the base, never by
reorienting the arm -- there is no wrist-tilt scan step (an AprilTag-based
version of this used to exist; it needed a one-off wrist tilt to see a tag
lying flat on the column top, which conflicts with keeping the arm/wrist
orientation fixed, so placement uses the column's own body colour instead
of a tag).

Reuses Mission/NavAndPick (navigate_to, claw_approach/claw_pick, grab_below,
_face_box) and PickAndPlace (colour detect, gripper, move_pose).

# became a Husky A200: the floor is now at GROUND_Z = -0.13228 instead of
# -0.05. They are written as offsets from GROUND_Z so they stay pinned to real
# heights above the floor rather than drifting with the chassis.
#
# On top of that, poses are now commanded for fr3_hand_tcp (the FINGERTIP
# frame, between the jaws) where they used to be for gripper_base (the gripper
# BODY, which sat ~0.08 m above the held box). So a grasp z is now roughly the
# box CENTRE height, not the body height above it.
# Nav2 parks the base with the box ~1.00 m ahead, and claw_approach then servos
# the last 0.30 m in on the front camera. It must NOT drive closer than this:
# the Husky's bumper is at base_link x=0.4937 and the table's near face is
# 0.125 m in front of the box line, so at 1.00 m standoff there is 0.38 m of
# clearance, while the old 1.45 m (0.85 m standoff) was tuned for a 0.38 m-long

# never moves for this -- it holds zdown throughout -- so there is no ARM
# reachability cliff to guard against (unlike the old AprilTag design, which
# read an actual measured position that could land beyond accurate arm
# reach): the visual servo itself drives to the right standoff distance.
# There IS still a camera-VISIBILITY cliff, though: if Nav2 arrives too far
# off-heading, the column is outside the front camera's FOV and
# approach_column's bounded _face_box correction (capped ~57 deg) cannot
# recover it -- confirmed live (column 1 arrival >57 deg off, zero pixels

# with the bumper 0.17 m INSIDE the column. 1.10 leaves 0.51 m of bumper
# clearance, keeps the whole column inside the front camera's cone at arrival

# heading error beyond approach_column's ~57deg correction cap leaves the

# approach: measured (ground-truth Gazebo pose vs the front camera's own
# detection at grasp time) a real ~3.5cm lateral grasp-centering error that
# traced back to the base arriving at the table ~10.5deg off the intended
# straight-on heading -- an off-axis camera view biases the HSV-mask
# centroid (the box's visible faces shift with viewing angle), and unlike
# the column-placement overshoot (a FIXED bias, fixable with a constant
# offset) this error scales with arrival angle, so a fixed TABLE_X_OFFSET-
# style correction is the wrong tool; keeping the approach angle small is.
# Tightened for both the table and column approach goals, restored right

        it? Everything above this point can succeed -- IK solved, cartesian
        lower executed, gripper opened -- while the box drops into thin air
        short of the column, because none of those steps observe the box after
        release. That is not hypothetical: a full 3-box run logged "PLACE:
        DONE" three times with all three boxes measured flat on the floor
        (z=0.0225, i.e. half a 0.045 m cube) and every column untouched.

        The check is the box's own height: detect_box_front already returns the
        blob centroid in base_link, and a box resting on the floor sits at
        EXPECTED_BOX_Z while one on the column top sits a full `height` higher.
        Anything below the midpoint between the two is a failed placement.

        The detection MUST be gated to just above the column top, because each
        column is deliberately painted its box's colour -- so an ungated
        'is there a red blob?' sees the pillar and the box as ONE blob, and the
        pillar wins on area (now 0.20 wide x 0.30-0.50 tall against the box's
        0.06, i.e. far MORE lopsided than before). A placed box would barely
        shift that area-weighted centroid, so the ungated check would fail
        every SUCCESSFUL placement. Gating to a band around where the box
        itself must be leaves the pillar out of the blob entirely.

        The gate is in the CAMERA frame, so the world height of the placed box
        (column top + half a box, above the FLOOR) has to be converted by
        subtracting the camera's own height. That conversion is why the old
        bound was wrong for this robot: it assumed a camera ~0.05 m off the
        floor, and the front camera sits at FRONT_CAM_Z = 0.223 m, so a
        correctly-placed box reads ~0.22 m LOWER in camera z than the old
        expression predicted -- the gate would have excluded every real
        placement. Both bounds are computed from FRONT_CAM_Z, so they follow the
        lens automatically; nothing here needs touching when it moves.

        Visibility at the lower lens height was a worry -- the box sits centred
        on a 0.20 m-deep column, so it is set back 0.07 m behind the column's
        near face, and a pinhole argument said the sight line grazing that
        face's top edge, plus the 73.7 deg vertical cone, should leave the
        0.40 m and 0.50 m columns' boxes invisible from base_link (0.425,
        0.091). MEASURED, THAT IS WRONG: a full 3-box run verified all three,

            red   (0.30 m column)  box z=0.202 vs column top 0.198
            green (0.40 m column)  box z=0.303 vs 0.298
            blue  (0.50 m column)  box z=0.405 vs 0.398

        with ground truth afterwards confirming all three boxes on their
        columns (z = 0.330 / 0.430 / 0.530). The pinhole model was too
        pessimistic: the servo stops nearer 0.73 than the assumed 0.75, and the
        detector needs a blob centroid rather than a fully unoccluded face. Kept
        as a note because if this check ever DOES start failing on the tall
        column while ground truth says the box is placed, the cause is
        geometric visibility, not the gate -- and the fix is to back the base
        off ~0.2 m before looking, not to widen the gate."""

    # DO NOT set COLUMN_DEPTH_BIAS here. A previous session concluded this
    # world's camera under-reads the column distance by 0.22 m, by comparing
    # the released box's true Gazebo pose against the base's AMCL pose -- but
    # AMCL was itself 2.6 m out at the time, so that "bias" was an artefact of
    # mixing a broken frame with a true one. Measured directly instead, with
    # the sim paused and ground truth read from `gz model -p`: base 0.550 m
    # from the column CENTRE, 0.490 m from its near FACE, camera reads 0.493 m
    # (three identical readings). The camera is accurate to 3 mm -- it simply
    # reports the near face, i.e. it reads short by the column's half-width
    # (0.06), exactly what the inherited COLUMN_X_OFFSET (0.038) already
    # compensates for in the plain warehouse world.
    #
    # Setting the bias non-zero here is actively destructive, which is how the
    # phantom was caught: with 0.22 the code turned a correct 0.334 m reading
    # into a believed 0.554 m and creeped the base 0.23 m into a column that
    # had only 0.14 m of clearance. The robot wedged against it (ground truth
    # afterwards: base -0.750, column face -0.940, i.e. bumper flush, zero
    # gap) and the wheels span in place for the creep's full 25 s timeout --
    # 25.4 s x 0.12 m/s = 3.05 m of phantom wheel odometry, which is precisely
    # the 3.0 m odom-vs-truth offset the run ended with, and precisely why
    # AMCL then reported the robot 2.6 m from where it actually stood.
