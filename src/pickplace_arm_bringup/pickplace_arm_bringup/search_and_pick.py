"""
Autonomous search-and-pick: drives the mobile base to find the box using the
wrist-mounted camera, then hands off to the existing, already-verified
pick-and-place sequence in pick_and_place.py (unmodified) for the precise
grasp.

Behavior:
  1) Arm holds a forward-and-down "search" pose so the camera can see ahead
     of the robot while it drives.
  2) SEARCH: spin in place, running the same HSV+point-cloud box detector
     used for the close-up pick, until the box is seen. If a full rotation
     finds nothing, drive forward a short distance and spin again.
  3) APPROACH: once seen, steer toward the box (proportional control on
     bearing + distance, both computed directly from detect_box_pose's
     base_link-frame result) until it's within the arm's known reach.
  4) Stop the base, then call the inherited run() -- the exact same
     precise scan+detect+grasp+place sequence pick_and_place.py already
     uses for a stationary robot, untouched.

# A single scan pose used for the entire search+approach. Its pitch is chosen
# so its box-detection swath on the ground is CONTINUOUS from ~1.1m out down
# to ~0.45m -- wide enough to spot the box while spinning yet reaching close
# enough to hand off to the pick. This replaces the earlier two-pose scheme
# (a shallow "forward-search" pose + a steep close-up pose): after the arm
# was shortened 30% the two poses' detection ranges no longer overlapped,
# leaving a ~[0.5,0.9]m dead zone the approach fell into and never recovered
# from. Empirically (teleport-and-detect sweep) this pose detects the box
# reliably across [0.45, 1.1]m; the steeper close-up SCAN_POSITION/SCAN_PITCH
# that pick_and_place.run() uses for the final grasp scan covers [0.40,0.50]m,
# so stopping the base with the box near ~0.45m keeps the handoff in range.

# box is both in-FOV and a fresh cloud lands, which the camera can miss under
