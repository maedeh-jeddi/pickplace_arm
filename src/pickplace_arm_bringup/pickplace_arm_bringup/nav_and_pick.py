"""Autonomous navigate-and-pick.

Builds on the mobile search-and-pick, but replaces the naive "spin then drive
straight at the box" long-range motion with real Nav2 goal-based navigation
(global path planning + costmap obstacle avoidance). Once Nav2 has driven the
base to a pose ~APPROACH_DIST in front of the box, control is handed off to
the already-verified visual servo (SearchAndPick.search_and_approach) for the
final precise positioning and then the inherited arm run() pick sequence.

Flow:
  1) Arm -> search pose; spin in place (high-priority /cmd_vel_search via
     twist_mux) until the box is first detected.
  2) Transform the box from base_link into the map frame (slam_toolbox
     supplies map->odom; diff_drive supplies odom->base_link).
  3) Compute an approach goal ~APPROACH_DIST from the box, on the robot->box
     ray, facing the box; send it as a Nav2 NavigateToPose goal. Nav2 plans a
     path and follows it, steering around obstacles (base-level avoidance).
  4) On arrival, run the inherited visual search_and_approach() to servo the
     last short distance precisely, then run() to scan/grasp/carry/place.

The arm keeps its existing MoveIt collision-aware planning unchanged.
