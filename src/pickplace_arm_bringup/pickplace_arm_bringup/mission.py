"""Full autonomous warehouse mission.

State machine (localizing on the saved map with AMCL, navigating with Nav2):
  INIT     wait for AMCL localization (map -> base_link TF).
  SEARCH   patrol the map via Nav2 NavigateThroughPoses (drive between
           locations WITHOUT stopping) while the base-mounted FRONT camera
           watches for the box; on a stable detection, cancel the patrol.
  APPROACH transform the box into the map frame, Nav2 to a pose ~0.6 m in
           front of it, then the wrist-camera visual servo for the final
           precise positioning.
  PICK     arm picks the box up and holds it in the carry pose.
  DELIVER  Nav2 to the pre-defined delivery point, carrying the box.
  PLACE    arm puts the box down and returns home.
  PARK     Nav2 to the parking station and stop.

Builds on NavAndPick (navigate_to / box_in_map / make_map_goal /
search_and_approach) and PickAndPlace (detect_box_front / pick_up_box /
place_box_down).
