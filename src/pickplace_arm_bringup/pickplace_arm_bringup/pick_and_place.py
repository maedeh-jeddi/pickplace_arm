Full pick-and-place for the pickplace_arm in Gazebo Harmonic.

Uses MoveIt (via pymoveit2) for collision-aware motion planning of the arm,
the ros2_control gripper controller for the physical grasp, and the MoveIt
planning scene (attach/detach) so the box is carried correctly and shown in
RViz. The box is a real, physics-enabled model spawned in Gazebo, so a
successful run physically moves it from the pick pose to the place pose.

The box's (x, y) is not known in advance: the arm moves to a fixed scan pose,
the wrist-mounted RGB-D camera locates the box by color in the point cloud,
and that detected position (transformed into base_link via TF) drives the
grasp -- move the box and re-run and it is found and picked again.

Robot: Clearpath Husky A200 base + Franka FR3 (7 DOF) + Franka Hand.

Geometry (all arm poses are for the `fr3_hand_tcp` link, in `base_link`):
  * pick  : box on the ground, (x, y) from detection -> grasp z at the box
            centre, pre-grasp 0.12 m above it
  * place : ground at PLACE_XY

NOTE: the numeric pose constants below have NOT been re-verified for this
robot. They were swept with /compute_ik against a 6-DOF placeholder arm on a
much smaller chassis, and are carried over here only as plausible starting
points. See the comments on each for what specifically needs redoing.

#     0.65 m, so its underside (0.62) clears the scan plane by ~0.17 m and
#     cannot be self-detected as an obstacle dead ahead (the failure the old
#     0.18->0.30 tuning chain was chasing).
#   * FRONT CAMERA: at base_link (0.425, 0.091). The box at x=0.50 is now
#     AHEAD of the lens rather than behind it, but it still cannot occlude the
#     column search, for a stronger reason than before: it rides 0.40 m above

#     the camera's 73.7 deg vertical cone spans just z 0.057..0.125 in

# which on a Husky is directly over the robot's own top plate (the chassis
# spans x +/-0.494) and BEHIND the front camera at x=0.509 - so the gripper

# GRIPPER_X = 0.70 was chosen against three hard constraints, not tuned:
#   1. CLEAR OF THE ROBOT. The Husky chassis ends at x=0.4937, so anything the
#      gripper descends onto must be beyond that or the arm drives into its own
#      top plate. 0.70 leaves 0.21 m of clearance.
#   2. IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. front_camera_link is at x=0.425; the claw point
#      must be ahead of it to be seen at all. 0.70 puts the target 0.275 m ahead
#      of the lens - past its 0.05 m near clip, and at that range its 73.7 deg
#      vertical FOV spans floor heights 0.02..0.43, which brackets the 0.30 m
#      table top and the boxes standing on it (top at 0.36). The lower lens
#      buys MORE range here, not less: the old mount saw 0.19..0.48 at 0.19 m.
#   3. COMFORTABLY REACHABLE. 0.62 m from the arm base, i.e. 73% of the FR3's
#      0.855 m reach, so it is nowhere near the singular edge.
# READY_Z holds the fingertips 0.50 m up: high enough to clear the 0.36 m box
# tops while driving, low enough that the descent is short.

# beyond the Husky's front bumper (chassis front face is at x=0.4937).

# THE WRIST CAMERA'S AXIS MOVED BY 90 DEGREES. On the old gripper the camera
# looked along gripper_base's +x, which is PERPENDICULAR to the approach
# direction (+z) - hence the old note that at zdown the camera saw only
# horizontally and scanning needed a pitched pose. On the Franka Hand the
# camera is mounted looking along the hand's +z, i.e. ALONG the approach axis
# (see camera_joint in the URDF), so it now sees exactly where the gripper is
# going. That is the better arrangement, but it inverts what `pitch` means.
#
# SCAN_PITCH is therefore the old 83.6 deg plus exactly the 90 deg the camera
# axis rotated by. scan_quat(pitch) rotates about y, mapping the camera axis
# to (cos p, 0, -sin p) before and (sin p, 0, cos p) now; at 173.6 deg that
# gives (0.1115, 0, -0.9938), the SAME look direction the old 83.6 deg
# produced - near straight down, tilted slightly forward.
#
# SCAN_POSITION holds the fingertips out beyond the bumper and high, so the
# wrist camera (0.0634 m behind hand_tcp along the approach axis) looks down
# over the workspace from ~0.75 m. Only the standalone pick_and_place demo uses
